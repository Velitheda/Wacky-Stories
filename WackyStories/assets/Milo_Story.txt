Once upon a time there was a dog called /1name_(male). /1 enjoyed /2verb-ing in his kennel all day long. But occasionally he decided to go on long walks down the /3noun all by himself. One day, /1 saw a /4noun. The /4 asked /1 to do /5number starjumps and it would give him /6plural_noun in return. /1 left feeling /7emotion because he knew he could not do what the /4 asked.
